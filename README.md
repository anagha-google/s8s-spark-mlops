# Practical Machine Learning at scale with Spark on GCP and Vertex AI


## 1. About

REWRITE THIS<br>
This repo is a hands on lab for [Spark MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html) based machine learning on Google Cloud, powered by Dataproc Serverless Spark and showcases integration with Vertex AI AIML platform. The focus is on demystifying the products and integration (and not about a perfect model), and features a minimum viable example of customer churn prediction.

## 2. Format
The lab is fully scripted (no research needed), with (fully automated) environment setup, data, code, notebooks, orchestration, commands, and configuration. Clone the repo and follow the step by step instructions for an end to end MLOps experience.

## 3. Level
L300. 

## 4. Audience
The intended audience is anyone with access to Google Cloud and interested in the features showcased and want to kick the tires.

## 5. Prerequisites
Knowledge of Apache Spark, Machine Learning, and GCP products would be beneficial but is not entirely required, given the format of the lab. Access to Google Cloud is a must.

## 6. Goal
Simplify your learning and adoption journey of our product stack for scalable data science with - <br> 
1. Just enough product knowledge of Dataproc Serverless Spark & Vertex AI integration for machine learning at scale on Google Cloud<br>
2. Quick start code for ML at scale with Spark that can be repurposed for your data and ML experiments<br>
3. Terraform for provisioning a variety of Google Cloud data services that can be repurposed for your use case<br>

## 7. Use case covered
Telco Customer Churn Prediction with a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) and [Spark MLLib, Random Forest Classifer](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-classification-regression.html#random-forest-classifier)<br>
