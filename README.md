# Practical Machine Learning at scale with Spark on GCP and Vertex AI



### WORK IN PROGRESS

1. Clone this repo
2. Provision your environment using Terraform
3. Author Spark ML code in Serverless Spark interactive notebooks
4. Operational Spark ML code into PySpark scripts & test from CLI
5. Author a Vertex AI pipeline for model training from a notebook on User Managed Notebook instance
6. Schedule model training pipeline with Cloud Scheduler
7. Author a Vertex AI pipeline for batch scoring from a notebook on User Managed Notebook instance
8. Author an Airflow DAG that executes a batch scoring Vertex AI pipeline
9. Run the DAG in Cloud Composer
10. Destroy resources upon lab completion
