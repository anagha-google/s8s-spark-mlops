# About

In this module, we will author and test a Vertex AI pipeline to orchestrate the Spark ML model training and prepare for operationalizing the same. The module takes about an hour to complete.

## 4. About authoring a Vertex AI pipeline 
We will use Vertex AI User Managed Notebook environment for this exercise and this is already created for you. When you open JupyterLab, you will also see a pre-created, customized notebook to get quick-started with learning pipeline authoring.

### 4.1. About Vertex AI pipelines



### 4.2. What is supported for Spark ML models in Vertex AI from an MLOps perspective?


### 4.3. Taking a pipeline developed in a notebook to production - steps involved

<hr>

## 5. Review and execute a Vertex AI pipeline from a notebook




## 6. Study the pipeline JSON




## 7. Test the JSON via Vertex AI pipeline UI




## 8. Edit the JSON for on-demand REST calls & persist in GCS

This concludes the module. In the [next module](../05-lab-guide/Module-06-Author-CloudFunction-For-Vertex-AI-Pipeline.md) you will create a Cloud Function to execute the Vertex AI Spark ML pipeline.
